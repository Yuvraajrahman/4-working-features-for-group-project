# Course Timeline Feature

## Overview
The Course Timeline feature provides a visual representation of the course progression, showing important events from course creation to completion. It displays a vertical timeline with alternating content on both sides, using colorful icons and styling to distinguish different types of events.

## Features

### Timeline Events
1. **Course Start**: Shows when the room was created
2. **Assessments**: All assessments (quizzes, assignments, projects, exams) are displayed chronologically
3. **Course End**: Automatically added one day after the final exam

### Visual Design
- **Vertical Timeline**: Uses DaisyUI's `timeline-vertical` component
- **Alternating Sides**: Content alternates between left and right sides for visual balance
- **Colorful Icons**: Different assessment types have distinct icons and colors:
  - ðŸŽ“ Final Exam (red)
  - ðŸ“„ Mid-term Exam (orange)
  - âœ… Quiz (green)
  - ðŸ“š Assignment (blue)
  - ðŸ“… Project (purple)
  - ðŸŽ¯ Course Start/End (green/red)

### Styling
- Timeline boxes have colored borders (primary for left, secondary for right)
- Icons are color-coded based on assessment type
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
